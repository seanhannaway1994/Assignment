 Momentarily he caught O’Brien’s eye. O’Brien had stood up. He had taken off his spectacles and
 was in the act of resettling them on his nose with his characteristic gesture. But there was a 
 fraction of a second when their eyes met, and for as long as it took to happen Winston knew—yes, 
 he KNEW!—that O’Brien was thinking the same thing as himself. An unmistakable message had passed. 
 It was as though their two minds had opened and the thoughts were flowing from one into the other 
 through their eyes. ‘I am with you,’ O’Brien seemed to be saying to him. ‘I know precisely what you
 are feeling. I know all about your contempt, your hatred, your disgust. But don’t worry, I am on your
 side!’ And then the flash of intelligence was gone, and O’Brien’s face was as inscrutable as everybody
 else’s. 

 That was all, and he was already uncertain whether it had happened. Such incidents never had any sequel.
 All that they did was to keep alive in him the belief, or hope, that others besides himself were the
 enemies of the Party. Perhaps the rumours of vast underground conspiracies were true after all—perhaps
 the Brotherhood really existed! It was impossible, in spite of the endless arrests and confessions and
 executions, to be sure that the Brotherhood was not simply a myth. Some days he believed in it, some days
 not. There was no evidence, only fleeting glimpses that might mean anything or nothing: snatches of
 overheard conversation, faint scribbles on lavatory walls—once, even, when two strangers met, a small
 movement of the hand which had looked as though it might be a signal of recognition. It was all guesswork:
 very likely he had imagined everything. He had gone back to his cubicle without looking at O’Brien again.
 The idea of following up their momentary contact hardly crossed his mind. It would have been inconceivably
 dangerous even if he had known how to set about doing it. For a second, two seconds, they had exchanged
 an equivocal glance, and that was the end of the story. But even that was a memorable event, in the locked
 loneliness in which one had to live.

 Winston roused himself and sat up straighter. He let out a belch. The gin was rising from his stomach.
 His eyes re-focused on the page. He discovered that while he sat helplessly musing he had also been 
 writing, as though by automatic action. And it was no longer the same cramped, awkward handwriting as
 before. His pen had slid voluptuously over the smooth paper, printing in large neat capitals—DOWN WITH
 BIG BROTHER DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER over
 and over again, filling half a page. 

 He could not help feeling a twinge of panic. It was absurd, since the writing of those particular words
 was not more dangerous than the initial act of opening the diary, but for a moment he was tempted to tear
out the spoiled pages and abandon the enterprise altogether.
